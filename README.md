## Quick Start

### Installation

#### Using Go

```bash
go install github.com/common-creation/coda@latest
```

#### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/common-creation/coda.git
cd coda
make build
```

### Configuration

1. Initialize configuration:
```bash
coda config init
```

2. Set your API key:
```bash
# For OpenAI
coda config set-api-key openai

# For Azure OpenAI
coda config set-api-key azure
```

3. (Optional) Configure settings:
```bash
coda config set ai.model gpt-4
coda config set ai.temperature 0.7
```

### Basic Usage

#### Interactive Chat Mode

```bash
# Start interactive chat
coda chat

# Use a specific model
coda chat --model gpt-4

# Continue previous session
coda chat --continue
```

#### Non-Interactive Mode

```bash
# Single prompt
coda run "Explain this code: print('Hello, World!')"

# Process file
coda run --input main.go "Add comments to this Go code"

# Save output
coda run --output analysis.md "Analyze the architecture of this project"

# Pipe input
cat error.log | coda run "What's causing this error?"
```

## Commands

### `coda chat`
Start an interactive chat session with the AI assistant.

**Options:**
- `--model`: Specify AI model to use
- `--no-stream`: Disable streaming responses
- `--continue`: Continue last session
- `--no-tools`: Disable tool execution

### `coda run`
Execute a single prompt in non-interactive mode.

**Options:**
- `--input, -i`: Read input from file
- `--output, -o`: Save output to file
- `--model, -m`: Specify AI model

### `coda config`
Manage CODA configuration.

**Subcommands:**
- `show`: Display current configuration
- `set KEY VALUE`: Set a configuration value
- `get KEY`: Get a specific value
- `init`: Initialize configuration file
- `validate`: Check configuration validity
- `set-api-key`: Securely store API keys

### `coda version`
Display version information.

**Options:**
- `--verbose, -v`: Show detailed version info
- `--json`: Output as JSON

## Configuration

CODA looks for configuration in these locations (in order):
1. Command line flag: `--config`
2. Environment variable: `CODA_CONFIG`
3. `$HOME/.coda/config.yaml`
4. `./config.yaml`

### Configuration File Example

```yaml
ai:
  provider: openai  # or "azure"
  model: gpt-4
  temperature: 0.7
  max_tokens: 2048

tools:
  enabled: true
  auto_approve: false
  allowed_paths:
    - "."
  denied_paths:
    - "/etc"
    - "/sys"

session:
  max_history: 100
  max_tokens: 8000
  persistence: true

logging:
  level: info
  file: ~/.coda/coda.log
```

### Environment Variables

All configuration options can be set via environment variables:

```bash
export CODA_AI_PROVIDER=openai
export CODA_AI_MODEL=gpt-4
export CODA_AI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

## Workspace Configuration

CODA supports project-specific configuration through workspace files:

### `.coda/CODA.md` or `.claude/CLAUDE.md`

```markdown
# Project Instructions

This is a React TypeScript project using Next.js 14.

## Rules
- Always use TypeScript strict mode
- Prefer functional components with hooks
- Follow the project's ESLint configuration

## Context
- Main API endpoint: /api/v1
- Database: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- Authentication: NextAuth.js
```

## Available Tools

CODA includes several built-in tools for file operations:

- **read_file**: Read contents of a file
- **write_file**: Create or overwrite a file
- **edit_file**: Modify specific parts of a file
- **list_files**: List directory contents
- **search_files**: Search for files by content or name

All tool operations require user approval by default for security.

## Security

CODA implements several security measures:

- **Sandboxed File Access**: Operations are restricted to allowed paths
- **Approval System**: Dangerous operations require explicit user consent
- **API Key Encryption**: Credentials are stored securely
- **Path Validation**: Prevents directory traversal attacks

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.21 or higher
- Make (optional, for using Makefile)

### Building

```bash
# Build for current platform
make build

# Build for all platforms
make build-all

# Run tests
make test

# Run linter
make lint
```

### Development Workflow

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**API Key Not Found**
```bash
# Check if API key is set
coda config get ai.api_key

# Re-set the API key
coda config set-api-key openai
```

**Permission Denied for File Operations**
- Check your `allowed_paths` configuration
- Ensure you have proper file system permissions

**Connection Timeout**
- Verify your internet connection
- Check if you're behind a proxy
- Try increasing timeout in configuration

### Debug Mode

Enable debug mode for detailed logging:

```bash
coda --debug chat
```

Check logs at `~/.coda/coda.log`
